# Network Capacity Planning

## Question

How to plan network capacity for Named Data Networks (NDN)

1. How are NDNs different from traditional networks
   - why they require special planning
2. How do we model demand?
3. Planning architectures/strategies?
   - heirarchical
   - flat
   - fully connected, random connected
   - big nodes
   - more nodes
