# RP1/30 Proposal: Network Capacity Planning for Named Data Networks

## Introductuion

- how are NDNs different from traditional networks
  - data centric vs endpoint centric
  - signed data allows caching at all layers, like plaintext HTTP caching
  - special planning needed to leverage caching efficiently in coordination with network design
  - like current CDNs (especially network operated ones) but with greater potential (not limited by control over HTTPS)

## Question

How to plan network (capacity) for Named Data Networks (NDN)

- given known data set / unknown access patterns
- Cache aware network planning
- +geographic distribution
- - cost awareness
- +continuous monitoring + recalculation of optimization / min cost
- +autodeployment

#### In scope

- network design / layout / architecture
  - heirarchical / flat
  - fully / sparse / randomly connected
- cache size / placement
  - more / less / big / small
- multilayer network planning?
  - harder without specific constraints in mind
- demand modelling (timescale)
  - fixed / random / growth
- optimize for
  - deployed bandwidth vs effective bandwidth (QoS?)

#### Out of scope

- anything with linear / integer programming (hopefully)
- spare capacity placement
- coordinated caching
- proactive caching

## Method

TODO: how

## Considerations

TODO: other things

#### Resources

Possible access to a public cloud like Amazon Web Service or Microsogt Azure.

#### Ethics

We do not foresee any ethical concerns.
